# Separation of Shape and Temporal Patterns in Tme Series


This repository contains Wrapper Python for the code for averaging time series using elastic kernels defined and used in [1] with some extensions dedicated to the separation of shape and temporal pattern in time series as described in [2]. 

## Installation (tested on UBUNTU 16.04, 18.04)

To compile and install the C++ code with its python wrapper:

$ sh install.sh

## Running the noisy ellipses example

$ Python3 STS2_noisyEllipses.py
